# movie-recommendation-system
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that recommends movies based on similarity. It uses a content-based approach by analyzing movie features such as genre, cast, and overview. Text processing techniques and cosine similarity are used to find related movies. When a user selects a movie, the system suggests similar movies.
